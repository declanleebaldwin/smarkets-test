# Smarkets Front End Test

There are two repositories, smarkets which contains the front-end part of the application and smarkets-client which contains the back-end part of the application.

## smarkets-server (Back End)

The back end is a proxy node server that calls the smarkets api.

1. Ensure you have node and npm installed
2. Run npm init
3. Run npm install
4. Run node app.js
5. The node server will now be running on localhost:3000

## smarkets repo (Front End)

I have built this portion of the application using Vue-CLI.

1. Ensure you have node and npm installed
2. Run npm init
3. Run npm install
4. Run npm run serve
5. The app will now be running on localhost:8080

Once both the client and server applications are running, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in a browser of your choice.
